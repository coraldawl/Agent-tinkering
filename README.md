## Deploying MIMI

To deploy MIMIâ€™s frontend and backend to a production environment:

### **Frontend Deployment**

1. Use a web hosting service (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages):
   - Deploy the `index.html` and `index.js` files along with any other assets.
   - For example, using Vercel:
     ```bash
     vercel deploy
     ```

### **Backend Deployment**

1. Use a cloud service (e.g., Fly.io, AWS, or Heroku) for the backend:
   - Ensure your backend server is configured to handle requests from the frontend domain.
   - Example using Fly.io:
     ```bash
     fly deploy
     ```

2. Update the API endpoint in `index.js`:
   - Replace `http://localhost:3000/chat` with your deployed backend URL:
     ```javascript
     const response = await fetch('https://your-deployed-backend.com/chat', {
       method: 'POST',
       headers: {
         'Content-Type': 'application/json'
       },
       body: JSON.stringify({ message: input })
     });
     ```
